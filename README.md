# Flocking-Simulation
Boid Algorithm Simulator

This implements boids algorithm and uses the three pricipals of alignment, cohesion and seperation.
Quad tree was also incorporated to increase the efficiency of the program

Next Steps:
    Expand to 3D space.
    Simulate perching behaviour.
    Further refinement
